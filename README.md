# Thesis Analysis Repository

This repository contains all the data, scripts, and models used for my bachelor's thesis on the relationship between multicultural exposure and bias, measured through IAT scores and lexical valence.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to investigate how exposure to multicultural environments might influence both implicit and explicit attitudes. The analysis combines IAT results with self-reported data and linguistic measures derived from participant-generated words.

RMarkdown scripts:
| Script Name                      | Purpose                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data_cleaning.Rmd`              | Main pipeline for cleaning and preparing participant data           |
| `cleaning Warriner dataset.Rmd`  | Prepares the valence lexicon for use in later merging               |
| `Valence of generated words.Rmd` | Matches participant words with valence scores and computes averages |
| `final models updated.Rmd`       | Contains all final regression models and visualizations             |
| `models diagnostics.Rmd`         | Contains diagnostics of all final models                            |





## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thesis-analysis.git
   cd thesis-analysis

2. **Open the project in RStudio**
Make sure the working directory is set to the folder containing these files.

3. **Install required R packages**
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readr", "broom", "patchwork", "showtext"

4. **Run the scripts in this order:**

- cleaning Warriner dataset.Rmd

- data_cleaning.Rmd

- Valence of generated words.Rmd

- final models.Rmd

These scripts will clean and merge the data, compute the relevant scores, and generate the regression models and plots used in the thesis.
